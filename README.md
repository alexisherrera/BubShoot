# BubShoot
BubbleShooter game that I developed in Java using the Swing library! 

## Getting Started

To get this running locally I recomend downloading the entire repo and saving it into a folder. Once saved compile the Game.java file and run the Game.class file through the command line. If you have an IDE like Eclipse you could simply run the Game.java file.

### Clone repo

If you have git set up on your machine simply type the following line into your command line:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/alexisherrera/BubShoot
```
